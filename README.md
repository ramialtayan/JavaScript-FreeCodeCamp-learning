# JavaScript Learning Journey (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains all my JavaScript lessons and practice code while completing the **"Basic JavaScript"** certification from **freeCodeCamp**.

I am learning step by step, writing real code, solving challenges, and documenting my progress in organized folders so I can track my growth — and show it to recruiters.
